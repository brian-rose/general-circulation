    "\n",
    "We consider two means that are often used: *time* mean and *zonal* mean, along with deviations from these means.\n",

    "\n",
    "So if we take the time and zonal average of the continuity equation we get\n",

    "\n",
    "The first term is zero. **Why?**\n",

    "Let's now integrate over the depth of the atmosphere, from surface pressure $p_s$ to zero:\n",
