    "# Effect of eddies on the zonal mean circulation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw at the end of the last set of notes that both eddy momentum fluxes and eddy heat (buoyancy) fluxes are both involved in determing the zonal-mean flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial [u]}{\\partial t} &= f[v] -\\frac{1}{a\\cos\\phi} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} ([u^*v^*] \\cos\\phi) \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial [b]}{\\partial t} &= -N^2 [w] -\\frac{1}{a\\cos\\phi} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} ( [v^* b^*] \\cos\\phi ) + \\dot{Q} \n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the effects of an eddy heat flux on a frictionless, adiabatic system ($\\dot{Q} = 0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "At steady state, the thermodynamic equation tells us that we must have an Eulerian mean overturning circulation with vertical component\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ [w] = -\\frac{1}{a\\cos\\phi N^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} ( [v^* b^*] \\cos\\phi ) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "which in turn, by mass conservation, requires a horizontal component of the overturning $[v]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But $[v]$ enters into the momentum equation through the Coriolis force.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, *eddy heat fluxes must **accelerate** the zonal mean zonal wind $[u]$ through Coriolis forces associated with the overturning circulation*. Eddy heat fluxes appear in the zonal mean momentum equation disguised as Coriolis force.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you confused yet?\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe there's a better way to express the **combined effect of eddy heat and momentum fluxes** that clarify under what conditions the eddies can accelerate the mean zonal flow $[u]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Related, we've also seen that the Lorenz cycle reveals substantion conversion from eddy kinetic energy to kinetic energy of the mean flow]\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we may also find a better way to think about the overturning circulation in a flow dominated by eddies."

    "\n",
    "This is actually a deep result. $v_{res}$ is determined entirely by the zonal diabatic heating, regardless of what the eddies are doing. Our transformed momentum equation tells that there's a very specific combination of eddy heat and momemtum fluxes that accelerate the zonal mean wind. \n",
