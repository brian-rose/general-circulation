    "# Effect of eddies on the zonal mean circulation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw at the [end of the last set of notes](https://brian-rose.github.io/general-circulation/lectures/hadley.html#effects-of-eddies-on-the-hadley-cell-qualitative-and-diagnostic-arguments) that both eddy momentum fluxes and eddy heat (buoyancy) fluxes are both involved in determing the zonal-mean flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial [u]}{\\partial t} &= f[v] -\\frac{1}{a\\cos\\phi} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} ([u^*v^*] \\cos\\phi) \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial [b]}{\\partial t} &= -N^2 [w] -\\frac{1}{a\\cos\\phi} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} ( [v^* b^*] \\cos\\phi ) + \\dot{Q} \n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the effects of an eddy heat flux on a frictionless, adiabatic system ($\\dot{Q} = 0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "At steady state, the thermodynamic equation tells us that we must have an Eulerian mean overturning circulation with vertical component\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ [w] = -\\frac{1}{a\\cos\\phi N^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} ( [v^* b^*] \\cos\\phi ) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "which in turn, by mass conservation, requires a horizontal component of the overturning $[v]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But $[v]$ enters into the momentum equation through the Coriolis force.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, *eddy heat fluxes must **accelerate** the zonal mean zonal wind $[u]$ through Coriolis forces associated with the overturning circulation*. Eddy heat fluxes appear in the zonal mean momentum equation disguised as Coriolis force.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you confused yet?\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe there's a better way to express the **combined effect of eddy heat and momentum fluxes** that clarify under what conditions the eddies can accelerate the mean zonal flow $[u]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Related, we've also seen that the [Lorenz cycle](https://brian-rose.github.io/general-circulation/lectures/ape.html#diagram-of-the-lorenz-energy-cycle) reveals substantial conversion from eddy kinetic energy to kinetic energy of the mean flow]\n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, we may also find a better way to think about the overturning circulation in a flow dominated by eddies."

    "This is actually a deep result. $v_{res}$ is determined entirely by the zonal diabatic heating, regardless of what the eddies are doing. Our transformed momentum equation tells that there's a very specific combination of eddy heat and momemtum fluxes that accelerate the zonal mean wind. \n",

    "$$[v^*q^*] = \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{F} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The divergence of the EP flux (which is a specific combination of eddy heat and momentum fluxes) is equivalent to a northward eddy flux of QGPV!\n",
    "\n",
    "So another form of the TEM equations is (under the quasi-geostrophic approximation):\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Now consider the fact that the diabatic heating tends to decrease from equator to pole. So $w_[res]$ might be upward near the equator and downward near the pole.\n",
    "\n",
    "We infer from this that $v_{res}$ must be poleward aloft (to conserve mass) -- i.e. $v_{res} > 0$. The residual circulation should look something like a big equator-to-pole scale Hadley cell!\n",
    "\n",
    "But this poleward residual circulation applies an *eastward* Coriolis force on the zonal wind. To have a steady balance, the eddies must be arranged to produce an equal and opposite *westward* force.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can infer from this that the eddies must be fluxing QGPV *equatorward*, i.e. $[v^* q^*] < 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the planetary PV increases toward the poles, the eddies are thus flux PV down the mean gradient. Unlike for momentum, the eddies behave diffusively in the PV framework -- acting to transport PV from the high reservoir near the poles to the low reservoir near the equator."
