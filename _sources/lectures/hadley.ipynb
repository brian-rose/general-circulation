    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've seen that the atmospheric circulation in the low latitudes is dominated by the zonally-symmetric overturning, while away from the equator the eddies tend to dominate.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen that there is a seamless transport of energy from the equator to the poles, despite the fact that the dominant transport mechanism changes from the MMC in the tropics to transient eddies in mid-latitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some questions we'd like to get physical insight into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What determines the strength of the Hadley circulation?\n",
    "- What determines the meridional extend of the Hadley circulation?\n",
    "- Can the Hadley circulation exist in the absence of eddies?\n",
    "- What roles are played by differential heating and eddies in the maintenance of the Hadley circulation?\n",
    "\n",
    "To start to answer these questions, we follow the classic paper by Held and Hou {cite}`Held:1980hu`.\n",
    "\n",
