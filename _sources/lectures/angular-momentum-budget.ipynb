    "We're going to talk about three key budgets of materially conserved quantities:\n",

    "1. Angular Momentum\n",
    "2. Energy\n",
    "3. Water Vapor\n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea running through these topics is that we have a quantity that *obeys some conservation principle* embeded in the equations of motion, and that over a \"long enough\" time period that quantity must be in **steady state** in the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any quantity in steady state, we must have a balance between local *sources* and *sinks* of that quantity and *flux divergence / convergence* of the same quantity.\n",

    "In addition to zonal and time averages, we will sometimes employ a vertical integral (weighted by mass):\n",
